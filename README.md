# LIBGRAPH

A chart engine based on OpenGL and SDL2 with the goal of being usable for desktop and web development.
It's supplied with a Angular wrapper library.
This is just a little side project I started for fun to test if it was possible to build a high performance chart engine for webapps.
It is still in a very early stage and is more of a playground for now though I plan on getting it into a usable state.
A little demo showing the current functionality can be found inside the `test-project`-folder.

## TODO

[ ] documentation
[ ] cleanup of the current code base
[ ] refactoring of the features from the heatmap-experimental branch into generic chart components.
